Hello Professor, sorry the Jupyter File is a mess, I couldn't manage to clean it up. I worked by myself on this problem set and all the code works well. 
Incase you don't want to run the code to get the answers, here are the answers to all the question except for Question 4, which you have to run to get the graph to show.

Question 1: Palau
Question 2: ('MNE', 'Montenegro', 'Europe', 'Baltic Countries', 2006, 'Milo Dukanovic') 
  the code is in the jupyter file
Question 3: ('Podgorica', 'MNE', 'Podgorica', 156000)
            ('Niksic', 'MNE', 'Niksic', 57000)
  again, code is in the jupyter file
